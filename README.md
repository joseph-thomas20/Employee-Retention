# Employee-Retention
An analysis of employee retention data, and the development of a method to predict the likelihood of employee departure. 

The task of this case study was to find out which employees were leaving, why they were leaving and to find a way to predict which employees are the most likely to leave. 

My analysis found that there were 3 main groups of employees that were leaving the company and analysis of the data was able to provide possible insights into what was causing their departures. 

To formulate a way to predict the likelihood of employee departure, I implemented a logistic regression model to derive the coefficients of each variable. Using random forest feature importance, I was able to derive the 5 most influential variables and used their logistic regression coefficients to develop my 'Employee Departure Equation' that.
